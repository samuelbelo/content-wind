# **Hi, I am** Samuel

I'm a passionate software engineer - Front End Specialist, Development Generalist and Open sourcerer.
I usually write code for large apps with mixed stacks | JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, React, Vue, S[CSS], Mongo, SQL, etc | and high traffic such as content portals, Software as a Service apps, industrial scale CMSes, Banking dashboards...

I help to evolve systems by using some System Design techniques - as decoupled architectures, micro-frontends, Framework-Agnostic Design Systems, UI-Kits, Service Workers for cache and SPA optimization, etc. I also develop in-house and open source tools to facilitate complex tasks and deliver a good and reliable development platform, reduce costs and risks related to the product.

That means: use cutting-edge technology to evolve products always aiming at the best experience for the customer, cost reduction and good development and maintenance workflow. Basically: Always trying to achieve the best results with the least complexity on the context.
